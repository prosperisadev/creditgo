# CreditGo 🇳🇬

**Bridging Nigeria's Credit Information & Behaviour Gap**

CreditGo is the "Intelligence Layer" for African credit. We are not a lender — we are a marketplace that connects invisible but capable borrowers to productive asset financing.

## 🎯 The Problem

In Nigeria, millions of mid-level professionals earn well (₦300k–₦1.5M/month), work hard, and contribute to the economy. Yet, they live one emergency away from financial crisis. They don't lack income; they lack access.

- **The Information Gap**: Most Nigerians don't know where to find financing for specific needs
- **The History Gap**: Financially active people have no formal credit record
- **The Behaviour Gap**: Borrowers default without guidance and support

## 💡 The Solution

CreditGo solves the information gap for users and the default risk for lenders through our **3-Step Engine**:

1. **Credit Capacity Assessment** - Discover your "Safe Amount" based on real income
2. **Need-Specific Discovery** - Connect to 20+ financing options for productive assets
3. **Behavioural Support** - SMS monitoring and repayment nudges

## 🧮 The "Safe Amount" Algorithm

```typescript
// Core algorithm for calculating safe repayment limit
const calculateSafeAmount = (monthlyIncome: number) => {
  const estimatedExpenses = monthlyIncome * 0.5;  // 50% expenses
  const disposableIncome = monthlyIncome - estimatedExpenses;
  const safetyBuffer = disposableIncome * 0.3;   // 30% buffer
  return disposableIncome - safetyBuffer;         // Safe Amount
};

// Example: ₦300,000 income → ₦105,000 safe monthly repayment
```
